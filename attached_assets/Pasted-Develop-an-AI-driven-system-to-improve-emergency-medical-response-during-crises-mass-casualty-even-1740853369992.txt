Develop an AI-driven system to improve emergency medical
response during crises (mass casualty events, disease
outbreaks) by providing rapid assessment, triage, treatment
guidance, and optimized resource allocation. The system should
leverage real-time data and AI to assist medical professionals in
making faster, more informed decisions, ultimately saving lives.
Context:
Crises like disease outbreaks or mass casualty incidents
overwhelm emergency medical services. Quick and accurate
triage, diagnosis, and treatment are crucial, but limited
resources and high patient volumes lead to delays and
difficulties. AI can augment human capabilities, providing timely
insights and automating tasks to improve the speed and
effectiveness of care, even under immense pressure. This
requires a system adaptable to the chaotic nature of
emergencies and capable of handling incomplete information.
Primary Objectives:
1. AI-Powered Triage
Create an AI agent that analyzes real-time patient data
(vitals, symptoms, initial assessments) to automatically
assign triage priority levels (e.g., immediate, urgent,
delayed).

Use predictive analytics to identify patients at highest risk of
critical conditions, enabling faster intervention
Provide a clear visual interface (e.g., dashboard) for responders
to quickly understand patient status.
2. Automated Critical Condition Detection
Develop AI algorithms to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT
scans) or wearable sensor data (ECG, pulse oximetry) to rapidly
detect life-threatening conditions (e.g., internal bleeding,
cardiac arrest, respiratory failure).
Provide confidence levels with diagnoses to aid human review.
3. Personalized Treatment Guidance
Build an AI agent that generates treatment recommendations
based on patient specifics (demographics, symptoms, medical
history â€“ if available), drug interactions, and current clinical
guidelines.
Offer clear, concise recommendations to medical personnel,
including medication dosages and suggested interventions.
4. Resource Allocation Optimization
Develop a system to simulate patient flow and resource
availability (ambulances, beds, staff, supplies) during a crisis.
Use AI to recommend optimal resource allocation strategies,
minimizing delays and maximizing the number of patients
treated within critical time windows.
